## How to use:
- Run the program
- Open Minecraft in Windowed Mode
- Choose the spot you want to timelapse (make sure you have commands enabled)
- Press "F10"
- Choose how many photos you want (24 means one photo every in-game hour, 48 means one photo every 30 minutes, etc.)
- Choose the delay between the screenshots being taken (this depends on your shader, mine worked fine with 2000)
- Wait for all of your photos to be taken
